# My (BI X) Release Countdown

This is a small script that implements a release countdown in pure HTML, CSS and JS.

You can see it in action at https://countdown.bi-x.info - no tracking is happening there

## To consider when deploying your own version

The whole code is available for re-use (MIT License), but the logo SVG's (my own circuit board MF logo as well as the BI X one) in the source **must** to be replaced in case you make your own deployments. Same is true for the [favicon.ico](./web/favicon.ico) as it is my own custom logo (will be replaced at one point in time).

## Third party stuff

The BI X Logo is the logo of my employer and must not be used without explicit permission!  
**This whole thing is not a [BI X](https://bix-digital.com) product**, it just happens that I am working there. This was a fun project made in my free time - but it is intended to be on the screens of our project teams as a reminder when we have the next release planned...

The included font is from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Titillium+Web) and part of this repo to have a full deployment from this place possible - and without loading any elements from third party servers.
